# Project 2: Sonnet27

##### by ernesto hernandez

### Project Overview

This is an animated website that brings Shakespeareâ€™s Sonnet 27 to life by using animation to reflect the emotional tones of the sonnet. It draws inspiration from a previous experience where I explored sound and mood in film, and I aim to achieve a similar impact through visual movement. This project reflects my belief in the power of creative collaboration and how it fosters a sense of community through shared artistic expression. The website is an exploration of how motion and design can deepen the connection between content and audience, transforming the act of reading into an immersive, engaging experience.

### Technical Overview

The website will feature a separate page for each line of Sonnet 27, with animations triggered automatically upon loading. On each page, hovering over individual words will replay their initial animations, allowing users to interact with the text dynamically. Additionally, clicking the last word of each line will navigate to the next page, where the subsequent line of the poem will be presented and animated. This setup combines interaction and progression, offering a unique way for users to explore the poem line by line.
